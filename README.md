I'm an educator turned data engineer in training with a passion for turning messy data into clean, reliable pipelines that power real-world decisions. With a foundation in SQL, Python, Snowflake, and Airflow, I’ve transitioned from analyzing student outcomes to building data infrastructure that supports scalable analytics.

I am actively building cloud-based projects that include ingesting, transforming, and modeling large datasets. I bring to data engineering the same skills that made me successful in the classroom: problem-solving, communication, and a drive to constantly improve through feedback and iteration.

Currently working on projects that involve:
- ETL pipelines using Python, BigQuery, and dbt
- Cloud storage and warehouse architecture
- Data quality testing and automation

Open to data engineering and analytics engineering opportunities where I can grow as part of a collaborative team. Let’s connect!
